# MTUI
## My Text User Interface

MTUI is a small project I've been working on for developing my own software, I challenged myself to write my own simple TUi framework.

I started this project to learn how UI frameworks were made and what the standard for one it, I'd previously used Java's swing framework, and had delved into the code of Windows Forms, so I decided to attempt to make a simple TUI framework myself.

It's still in an early stage, but I feel it has a lot of potential, so I intend to work on it until it has matured into a usable TUI framework, not just for myself.
